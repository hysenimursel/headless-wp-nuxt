<p>We tend to give less importance to our senses than they deserve and we don’t think about what would happen if one day we lose any of them. We never analyze what it would be like to live without seeing the colors or the light that comes through, but this is how thousands have to survive an aggressive world that is even more difficult when the eyes are no longer the guide. It is precisely in this way that <strong>Arafa, a beautiful little dog rescued from the streets of Cairo in Egypt,</strong> spent his days <strong>.</strong></p>

<h2>A MIRACULOUS RESCUE WITH INCREDIBLE PEOPLE.</h2>
<p>If for humans, who have the sense of speech, it is very difficult to go through a medical condition that prevents us from seeing, for a puppy it is much worse because it does not have the way to express how it feels or the needs it has. That was the challenge Arafa faced every day when she got up to survive on the streets of the Egyptian capital.</p>
<p>Arafa arrived at Furever Rescue Foster, a shelter that helps hundreds of stray dogs to have a stable and safe place where they can have their basic needs covered, on a sunny morning in which she did not imagine how her life and that of Ahmed Embaby would change. , one of the volunteer caretakers of the place.</p>
<figure id="attachment_23972" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-23972" title="Hearing the voice of this rescuer is the greatest happiness for this blind puppy 3" src="https://zoocloud.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/scale-_16_.jpg" alt="" width="792" height="594"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Ahmed Embaby</figcaption></figure>
<p>When the furry man entered the place on his own, the team couldn’t believe their eyes: <strong>not only was he completely blind, he had also managed to survive the rough life on the streets without any help</strong> .</p>
<p>The shelter took him in immediately to begin his recovery process and teach him to live in community, to guide him towards a well-being of life that he had probably never had.</p>
<h2>THERE IS ALWAYS SOMEONE SPECIAL AND DIFFICULT TO FORGET.</h2>
<p>Despite being an incredibly affectionate and kind puppy with all his caregivers, <strong>Arafa </strong><strong>developed a very particular affinity with one of them in particular</strong> , Ahmed Embaby, a lover of animals, who became that figure of admiration for the furry and although I couldn’t see it, I felt the deepest love of all.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Arafa is my blind guardian and follows me all day. –</em> Ahmed commented to The Dodo.</p>
<p> </p></blockquote>
<p>Without knowing why, <strong>the two created a special bond that has transcended as</strong> the days go by when Arafa continues to recover in the refuge. His love for Ahmed is so great that a video shared on his social networks made their friendship viral.</p>
<p><strong>In this clip you can see how,</strong> while the volunteer arrives in the morning for one more day of work, he makes a particular call to let Arafa know that he has already arrived, who runs from the back of the place with emotion to greet his friend.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Faembaby3%2Fposts%2F10217933176109626&show_text=false&width=552&height=552&appId" width="552" height="552" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<blockquote><p><em>It is exciting. The euphoria Arafa shows when I show up at Furever’s Refuge never ceases to amaze me. It just shows that a dog’s love is unconditional and extraordinarily pure. –</em> Ahmed said to The Dodo.</p></blockquote>
<p>The man who feels more than proud of his bond with the furry and the friendship that they have managed to cultivate, knows that they will not be forever in the life of the other, his fundamental objective is to <strong>find a family that loves Arafa and can give him the special care you need permanently.</strong></p>
<p>At some point this pair of close friends will say goodbye, but the cute little dog will have left a friend for life who will always be ready to help and assist him when he needs it.</p>

<p>For now, the puppy is recovering his emotional life with all the care of Ahmed and the volunteers and, although his eyesight will never improve, he is currently <strong>a much happier puppy than when he arrived at the shelter.</strong></p>

In those days, the delightful Husky was only a little dog and Kameroun was searching for a partner like never before as she was battling with extreme type of malignancy. She named her delightful textured companion Semper Fidelis, which signifies &#8216;Consistently dependable&#8217; in Latin. Furthermore, Semper was consistently dedicated to the lady that adored him more than anything in this world. </p>\n<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://heavenofanimals.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-9.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="433" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-964" srcset="http://heavenofanimals.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-9.jpg 660w, http://heavenofanimals.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-9-300x197.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>\n<p>In any case, in 2016 something horrible occurred.

Her cherished Husky had disappeared. </p>\n<p>Crushed, Kameroun had urgently attempted to discover Semper. She posted flyers and declarations all over, including on the web, yet it appeared to be that her canine evaporated. Luckily, the lady never lost her expectation and a year after Semper disappeared she never surrendered in looking for him. She even reached a private examiner, Ana Campos for help. It&#8217;s the point at which she discovered something amazingly bizarre. </p>\n<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://heavenofanimals.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-5.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="365" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-963" srcset="http://heavenofanimals.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-5.jpg 600w, http://heavenofanimals.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-5-300x183.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>&#8220;For a year, I kept looking while in California, posting up pamphlets through pet destinations, calling 15 vet puts around were I used to live over yonder about him, calling the altruistic social orders about him, cover,&#8221; Kameroun imparted to THE DODO. &#8220;At the point when [I] asked Ana Campos for more assistance, she recommended to check her AKC Reunite chip once more. So she went to the empathetic culture in May 2017 and they checked on the web … That is the point at which she found that a year sooner, on April 11, 2016, a lady added her name to Semper&#8217;s chip.&#8221; </p>\n<p>It worked out that organization that microchipped Semper the subsequent time, never checked in the event that he had a chip or a past proprietor as of now. Not long after, Semper was recorded available to be purchased on Craigslist for $200. That is the reason Semper had never appeared. </p>\n<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://heavenofanimals.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-2.jpeg" alt="" width="1584" height="891" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-962" srcset="http://heavenofanimals.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-2.jpeg 1584w, http://heavenofanimals.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-2-300x169.jpeg 300w, http://heavenofanimals.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-2-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, http://heavenofanimals.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-2-768x432.jpeg 768w, http://heavenofanimals.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-2-1536x864.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1584px) 100vw, 1584px" /></p>\n<p>However, at long last following more than two years and a great deal of tears Kameroun and Semper were going to see each other in an exceptionally enthusiastic get-together. &#8220;Having the option to assume a part in this gathering and being available was probably the greatest days of my life.
